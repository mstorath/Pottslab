# Pottslab 

Pottslab is a Matlab/Java toolbox for the reconstruction of 
jump-sparse signals and images using the Potts model (also known as "piecewise constant Mumford-Shah model" or "l0 gradient model").
Applications include denoising of piecewise constant signals, step detection and 
segmentation of multichannel image.

## Application examples

### Segmentation of vector-valued images


   - Supports segmentation of vector-valued images (e.g. multispectral images, feature images)
   - Linear complexity in number of color channels
   - Label-free: No label discretization required

### Joint image reconstruction and segmentation


   - Applicable to many imaging operators, e.g. convolution, Radon transform, MRI, PET, MPI: only implementation of proximal mapping reuqired
    - Supports vector-valued data
    - Label-free: Labels need NOT be chosen a-priori

### Denoising of jump-sparse/piecewise-constant signals, or step detection/changepoint detection


   - L1 Potts model is robust to noise and to moderately blurred data
   - Fast and exact solver for L1 Potts model
   - Approximative strategies for severely blurred data

## Usage Instructions
### Standalone usage from command line (only image plain image segmentation supported)
   - Call "java -jar pottslab-standalone.jar input output.png gamma" where gamma is a positive real number, e.g. 0.1 (thanks to fxtentacle)

### Installation for Matlab (all features usable)
#### Quickstart:
   - Run the script "installPottslab.m", it should set all necessary paths
   - For best performance, increase Java heap space in the Matlab preferences (MATLAB - General - Java heap memory)
   - Run a demo from the Demos folder

#### Troubleshooting:
   * Problem: OutOfMemoryException
   * Solution: Increase Java heap space in the Matlab preferences (MATLAB - General - Java heap memory)

   * Problem: Undefined variable "pottslab" or class "pottslab.JavaTools.minL2Potts"
   * Solution: 
        - Run setPLJavaPath.m
        - Maybe you need to install Java 1.7 (see e.g. http://undocumentedmatlab.com/blog/using-java-7-in-matlab-r2013a-and-earlier)

## Plugins for Image Analysis GUIs
Parts of Pottslab can be used without Matlab as pure Java plugins
   - [Icy plugin](http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/plugin/potts-segmentation/) - an interactive image segmentation plugin based on Pottslab (written by Vasileios Angelopoulos)
   - [ImageJ plugin](Plugins/PottsSegmentationJ_.jar) - an ImageJ frontend for Pottslab (written by Michael Kaul)
